The DeepSliced 5G project is a demonstration tool that showcases the capabilities of network slicing in 5G networks, utilizing deep learning techniques to optimize and manage virtual network slices. This project aims to illustrate how different slices within a 5G network can dynamically adapt to varying application requirements such as bandwidth, latency, and security.
