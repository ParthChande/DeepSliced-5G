The DeepSliced 5G project is a demonstration tool that showcases the capabilities of network slicing in 5G networks, utilizing deep learning techniques to optimize and manage virtual network slices. This project aims to illustrate how different slices within a 5G network can dynamically adapt to varying application requirements such as bandwidth, latency, and security.

# How It Works

The core of the 5G DeepSlice Demo leverages a deep learning model to achieve efficient network slicing:

**1. Data Preparation:**

Data from simulated or real-world network environments is collected and preprocessed to extract features relevant to network slicing parameters.

**2. Model Architecture:**

The neural network architecture, implemented using TensorFlow/Keras, is designed to predict optimal resource allocation and slice configurations based on input data.

**3. Training:**

The model is trained on historical data or simulations to learn patterns in network behavior and optimize resource utilization across different slices.

**4. Inference and Adaptation:**

During runtime, the trained model predicts optimal configurations for network slices based on real-time or simulated network conditions.
These predictions are used to dynamically allocate resources and adjust slice parameters to meet application-specific requirements.
